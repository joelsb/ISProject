# SOMIOD - Service Oriented Middleware for Interoperability and Open Data

**SOMIOD** is a middleware solution designed to address the *"SILO OF THINGS"* challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) by standardizing data usage across applications. It enables interoperability between devices and systems through a **REST API** and **MQTT message broker**, simplifying IoT integration and development.

---

## üìú Overview

The IoT ecosystem often suffers from fragmentation, where devices cannot easily share data due to different communication protocols and formats. SOMIOD solves this by:

- Providing a **RESTful API** for consistent data access and manipulation.
- Enabling communication between applications through an **MQTT Message Broker**.
- Supporting resource creation and subscription-based notifications.
- Promoting standardization to simplify development and encourage collaboration.

---

## üèó Architecture

**Main components:**
1. **SOMIOD REST API**
   - Handles `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests.
   - Connects applications to the database and enforces uniform data handling.

2. **Application A**
   - Creates *applications*, *containers*, and *subscriptions*.
   - Receives notifications when data changes.
   - Example: A gate controller that opens/closes based on data messages.

3. **Application B**
   - Creates *containers* and *data* resources.
   - Sends data to trigger actions in subscribed applications.

4. **MQTT Message Broker**
   - Manages real-time communication between applications.
   - Enables publish/subscribe data sharing.

## üöÄ Features

- **RESTful API** supporting:
  - Applications
  - Containers
  - Data
  - Subscriptions
- **MQTT-based communication** for efficient data exchange.
- **Example test cases**:
  - App A acts as a gate receiver.
  - App B sends "open" or "close" commands.
